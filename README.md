## Install
Clone the DPlatform git project, and then run it:
``` sh
sudo apt-get -y install git
cd ~ # Or whatever directory you want
git clone https://github.com/j8r/DPlatform
```
`sudo sh ~/DPlatform/dplatform.sh`

Next times, only run this last command for DPlatform


## Requirements

A recent GNU/Linux operating system with **SystemD** is highly recommended:

Debian 8 Jessie and derivatives like Ubuntu and Raspbian. Full support, well tested

CentOS 7, Fedora and other RHEL derivatives. Good support, not fully tested

Arch Linux. Partial support, not tested

A x86, x86-64 or armv[6,7,8] CPU.

Development is still active. Most things should work, but problems could occur, more testing is needed.
Please feel free to open an issue and create a pull request, all contributions are welcome!

## Roadmap

 ***The main goals of DPlatform are the independence, the freedom and the security. Therefore all installations and configurations provided through this set of shell tools are TOTALLY independents of it***

 - [1] Install apps efficiently through a terminal UI - In progress
 - (2) DPlatform Web GUI to manage apps easily - Early prototypes started
 - (3) Build a custom image with DPlatform Web GUI auto-configuration - Planned
 - DNS and secure firewall pass-trough via [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.me/)
 - Enhance the security. Nginx reverse proxy, [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate
