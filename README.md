## Requirements

A recent GNU/Linux operating system with **SystemD** is highly recommended:
Debian 8 Jessie and derivatives like Ubuntu and Raspbian
CentOS 7, Fedora and other RHEL derivatives

A x86, x86_64 or armv6, armv7 or armv8 CPU.

Development is still active. Most things should work, but problems could occur, more testing is needed.
Please feel free to open an issue and create a pull request, all contributions are welcome!

## Features
 - Install applications easily by following instructions printed
 - SystemD services integration - View apps services status, one clic start/stop, autostart at startup and autorestart when an error occurs
 - Update/Remove installed apps easily with two clicks
 - Determine your IPv4, IPv6, LocalIP and your host name
 - IP address and FQDN domain name configuration helping (generally in .com, .net...)
